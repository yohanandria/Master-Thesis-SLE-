## 📘 Abstract

This thesis provides an introduction to **Schramm–Loewner Evolutions (SLE)**, a family of random conformally invariant curves that arise in complex analysis and probability theory.  
The work explores the connection between **Brownian motion**, **harmonic measure**, and **Loewner’s differential equation**, which together form the foundation of modern approaches to **random geometry** and **conformal field theory**.

Emphasis is placed on the analytical construction of the *mapping-out function*, the conformal properties of simply connected domains, and the probabilistic interpretation of SLE as the scaling limit of discrete models.
